# Decentralized-Consensus-Facility
This project provides an open source decentralized consensus facility.

Here you will find the code and documentation for the decentralized consensus facility and the intial prototype (proof-of-concept) of the Decentralized Lending of Cryptocurrency use-case.

See the Decentralized Lending of Cryptocurrency white paper for additional detail.

This main repository is focused on the conceptual and logical model. There will be a few different repository/projects covering physical implementation. This is being done to facilitate a move from a Proof-of-Work based consensus on which the prototype proof-of-concept was done, to a proof of time/space model which is a much more energy efficient model for attaining decentralized consensus.

Documenting the conceptual/logical model which is implementation agnostic, is the current priority.
