Our proof-of-work approach for our decentralized consensus facility is similar in approach to what is described in this document:
https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/553.pdf

Ourtime-lock puzzle involves a defined lending workflow model, a Merkle DAG data structure for sequential workflow execution evidence,
and a publically verifiable proof of sequential work algoirthm.

The document describing our PoW algorithm is currently being drafted and will be uploaded once the draft has been completed and reviewed.
